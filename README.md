# Applicant-Resume_Analyzer
The Applicant Resume Analyzer (ARA) automates the resume screening and ranking process 
after candidates submit their applications. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and 
Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze resumes, extract important details such as skills, 
education, and experience, and categorize candidates based on their professional domain or job 
role. The system then ranks candidates within each category according to their relevance to 
specific job requirements or similarity to predefined role profiles. This approach ensures faster, 
unbiased, and data-driven shortlisting, significantly reducing manual HR effort while 
improving consistency and precision in candidate evaluation.
